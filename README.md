# Named-Entity-Recognition-with-Digitized-Museum-Collections-Data-from-Smithsonian-Open-Access


The Smithsonian Institution is the worldâ€™s largest museum, education, and research complex, with 21 museums, nine research centers, 21 library branches and Institutional archives, and the National Zoo. It holds more than 155 million objects and specimens, spanning art, history, culture, science, and technology. But can we connect the collectors and creators of these objects to each other in novel ways

his workshop will teach attendees how to use the Smithsonian's Open Access Data to perform named entity recognition (NER) on collections metadata. NER is a natural language processing (NLP) task that identifies named entities in text. Named entities are words or phrases that refer to specific people, places, things, or concepts. In the context of museum collections, named entities can be used to identify specimens and other collections objects, their creators/collectors, and the places where they were found. By the end of this workshop, attendees will have code that connects to Smithsonian collection data, can parse out specific entities, and find similarities with other collections objects.
